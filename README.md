- [Psychometric Analysis of Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale](https://github.com/asmendezleal/sample_projects/blob/master/Psychometric_Analysis_of_Right-Wing_Authoritarianism_Scale.ipynb "Psychometric Analysis of Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale"): Analyzed psychometric properties of an authoritarianism scale using confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and item response theory (R)

- [Neural Feature Encoding]("https://github.com/neurohackademy/feature-encoding"): Used Facebook's SlowFast classification model to extract features (e.g. kinetics) from video stimuli and built a feature encoding model using LASSO regression to examine which brain regions encode information about extracted features (Python)
