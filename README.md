# Sample Projects
Sample research and data analysis projects

- [Neural Feature Encoding](https://github.com/neurohackademy/feature-encoding): Used Facebook's SlowFast classification model to extract features (e.g. kinetics) from video stimuli and built a feature encoding model using LASSO regression to examine which brain regions encode information about extracted features (Python)

- [Psychometric Analysis of Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale](https://github.com/asmendezleal/sample_projects/blob/master/Psychometric_Analysis_of_Right-Wing_Authoritarianism_Scale.ipynb "Psychometric Analysis of Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale"): Analyzed psychometric properties of an authoritarianism scale using confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and item response theory (R)

- [The Batch Electroencephalography Automated Processing Platform (BEAPP)](https://github.com/lcnbeapp/beapp): Primary UI/software developer for open-source batch signal processing software. Created user documentation and focus group, acted asliaison between engineering team and expert and non-expert users
